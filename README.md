SereniDiary - A Simple Mental Health Journal
SereniDiary is a web-based journaling application that allows users to record their thoughts and emotions daily. The journal helps to track moods and encourages writing freely or responding to prompts. This app is designed to improve mental well-being by giving users an outlet for self-expression and reflection.

Journal Types: Choose between two types of journaling:

Prompt Questions: Answer a daily mental health question.

Writing Freely: Write your thoughts freely without any prompts.

Quote of the Day: Displays an inspirational quote when the page is loaded.

Past Entries: View saved past journal entries and prompt responses.

Save and Delete Entries: Users can save their entries and delete them later if needed.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and responsive across different screen sizes.

Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/serenidiary.git
Open in Browser After cloning, open index.html in your preferred browser.

No additional setup required: The app runs entirely in the browser, using localStorage to save entries.

Files in this Repository
index.html: The main HTML file that defines the structure and layout of the application.

case study style.css: The CSS file for styling the app, making it clean and user-friendly.

script.js: JavaScript file responsible for app logic, such as saving entries, handling moods, and interacting with localStorage.

How It Works
When you first open the app, you'll see a greeting message and a random inspirational quote.

You can select your mood for the day from the dropdown menu.

Choose whether you want to respond to a prompt or write freely in your journal.

Once you write an entry, you can save it, and it will be stored in your browser's localStorage.

You can view all your past journal entries and prompt responses by clicking the "Past Entries" button.

You can delete individual entries by clicking the "Delete" button next to each saved entry.

LocalStorage
Entries are stored in the browser using the localStorage API, which allows data to persist even after you close the browser. The entries are saved as:

Journal Entries: Mood and free text.

Prompt Responses: The prompt question and your response.
